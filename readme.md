# Sax Tracking in Ableton

Implemented a method to control Ableton Live parameters by changing the angle of my soprano saxophone. This was done by using Open CV to track red stickers on my saxophone, and Max MSP to process the results and send them to Ableton. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxiXGSNtSFk) a demo!

This idea was inspired by the youtube channel Nice Touch and their video [here]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRrFFGOX6Sc&))
